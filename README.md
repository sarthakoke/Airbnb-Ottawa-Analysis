# Capital Insights: Unveiling Airbnb Dynamics in Ottawa

## Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of the Airbnb open dataset for Ottawa, Ontario. The aim was to uncover insights into the local Airbnb market, understand host activity, and identify trends in property listings and pricing. The analysis was performed using Tableau to visualize the data effectively.

## Inspiration
The analysis was driven by several key questions:
- What can we learn about different hosts and areas?
- What insights can predictions provide (e.g., locations, prices, reviews)?
- Which hosts are the busiest and why?
- Is there any noticeable difference in traffic among different areas, and what could be the reason?

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of approximately 103,127 listings across 40 neighbourhoods, with 41 columns representing a mix of categorical and numeric values. Key columns include:
- `listing_id`: Unique ID of the property
- `listing_name`: Name of the listed property
- `host_id`: ID of the property owner
- `host_name`: Name of the property owner
- `listing_neighbourhood`: Specific location of the property
- `neighbourhood`: General area where the property is located
- `latitude` & `longitude`: Geographical coordinates
- `room_type`: Type of room offered
- `price_per_night`: Listing price in dollars
- `number_of_reviews`: Total number of reviews
- `last_review`: Date of the last review
- `reviews_per_month`: Average number of reviews per month

## Business Benefits
The analysis provides valuable insights for customers planning their travels, such as:
- Estimating accommodation expenses

This information can help increase tourism, enhance the company's reputation, and contribute to revenue growth.

- In which neighbourhood is there the maximum number of properties listed?
- Which host has the maximum number of properties listed?
- What is the average price in different properties listed?
- What is the most preferred room type in every neighbourhood?
